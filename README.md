For now my comments in the two apps are really bad,
but I think the code is pretty straight forward.


When running it locally simply use the `runserver`
from `python manage.py` like you're probably
doing in your other project, and `npm start` in
the react repo. Everything should be all hooked up
but there are lots of debug statements in both and
they are not suitable for anything beyond testing
and building right now. 

I made this because I thought it might be easier
for you to manage issues/what you think might be
useful as they come to you.

Lmk if I can help you with anything else, in the
meantime I'm going to try to keep adding features
and stuff that I need. Hopefully I'll package this
up with a nice installer so that You can spin up
a fresh ubuntu box on any cloud hoster and it will
get you all set up with deps and the likes.
